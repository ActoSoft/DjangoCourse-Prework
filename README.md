## Calendar events
- I already scheduled all the course sessions. Check you Google Calendar (related with your email) and you should see the invitation for that sessions. In these invitations you'll find the URL for join the Meet session.

## Slack channel
We'll use `Slack ` ([https://slack.com/intl/es-mx/downloads/](https://slack.com/intl/es-mx/downloads/)) to have a channel where we can talk about the course. I sent you a invitation for the channel to your email. Please, accept it and download the Slack app for your computer AND your mobile device.

## Recorded sessions
You can see again the session 12 hours after the session finish. The session will be uploaded to Youtube and they will be `private`. This means that the only way you could see the session is with you email. You'll receive a email with a notification about the session is uploaded.

## Questions, doubts, etc.
If you have any questions or doubt related to the couse, please ask ONLY IN THE SLACK CHANNEL. Not use Facebook, WhatsApp or other social network. The goal of use Slack is have a platform specify for communication between we.
